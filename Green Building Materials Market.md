**Key Market Drivers**

**1. Regulatory Pressure and Green Building Standards**

Global and regional regulatory frameworks are acting as a critical catalyst for market growth. Governments are mandating compliance with sustainability benchmarks such as **LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design), BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method), IGBC (Indian Green Building Council)**, and **WELL Building Standard**. These codes often offer incentives such as tax benefits, fast-tracked permits, or public recognition, pushing construction firms to incorporate eco-friendly materials.

Moreover, climate pledges and carbon neutrality goals—such as the **EU Green Deal**, **Canada’s Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 plan**, and **India’s National Action Plan on Climate Change**—are accelerating green construction mandates globally.

**2. Energy Costs and Lifecycle Optimization**

The economic viability of green materials is increasingly evident. Although upfront costs are often higher, they offer significant **long-term savings** through enhanced insulation, energy efficiency, lower maintenance, and improved durability.
