**Market Segmentation Analysis**

**By Installation Type**

**Overhead Cables**

Overhead installations remain a preferred choice in rural and semi-urban regions due to their low initial cost and ease of deployment. These cables are installed above ground on poles, making them relatively easy to access for repairs. However, they are also more vulnerable to environmental conditions such as storms and high winds, which can lead to frequent maintenance.

**Underground Cables**

Urban environments increasingly favor underground cable installations, driven by aesthetic concerns, space constraints, and the need for system safety. Though initial installation costs are higher, underground cables provide long-term benefits in terms of durability, reduced downtime, and protection from external damage. Their use is especially prominent in smart city infrastructure, urban transit systems, and modern commercial complexes.

**By Voltage Rating**

Low voltage cables are classified into three distinct voltage categories based on their application:

- **Up to 240V**: Typically used in residential and small commercial settings for lighting systems, televisions, and domestic appliances.
- **241V to 440V**: Common in small commercial and institutional setups, including HVAC systems, printers, and power tools.
- **441V to 1000V**: Utilized in industrial-grade machinery, warehouse automation systems, and power-hungry urban infrastructure requiring greater electrical load handling.

**By Application**

**Residential Sector**
