**Key Market Drivers**

**1. Health and Wellness Trends**

A major factor propelling the natural food and drinks market is the increasing consumer focus on health and wellness. Consumers are more informed about the ingredients in their food and are actively avoiding artificial additives, preservatives, and genetically modified organisms (GMOs).

The consumption of nutrient-rich, organic, and functional foods and beverages is no longer limited to niche markets; it has become a mainstream trend.

Modern urban lifestyles are often fast-paced, leaving limited time for meal preparation.

This shift in eating habits has significantly increased the demand for natural and functional food and drinks that can support energy, digestion, and immunity without compromising on health.

**3. Sustainability and Eco-Friendly Practices**

Environmental consciousness among consumers is influencing purchasing decisions. People are increasingly inclined to support brands that prioritize **eco-friendly practices**, including sustainable sourcing, reduced carbon footprints, and biodegradable or recyclable packaging.
