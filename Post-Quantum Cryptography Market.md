**Quantum-Resilient Security: Post-Quantum Cryptography Market Drivers and Dynamics**

**Rising Quantum Threat and Urgency for Cryptographic Resilience**

Quantum computers once a theoretical curiosity are rapidly transitioning into practical machines with capabilities that will soon outstrip today’s most advanced classical computers. These machines can solve mathematical problems used in current encryption protocols, such as prime factorization and discrete logarithms, in polynomial time using Shor’s algorithm. As a result, most of today's public-key cryptography will become obsolete once quantum systems mature.

This impending quantum threat has prompted aggressive investments in developing quantum-resistant cryptographic standards that can protect data confidentiality, system integrity, and digital identities even in a post-quantum world.

**Key Market Drivers**

**1. NIST Standardization Efforts:**\
The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has taken the lead in evaluating and standardizing post-quantum algorithms.
